## Todo Backend - Masonite Implementation

This is an example implementation of the Todo Backend API spec using Python, the Masonite framework and a sqlite database. An instance is running live on todo-backend-Masonite.herokuapp.com/api. You can run the Todo Backend specs against this implementation to check that it complies with the API spec.

I have not uploaded this app to heroku yet.
